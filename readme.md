# BioALG

BioALG is the website where I am solving popular problems from bioinformatics and computational biology. Problems of all difficulties from rosalind.info are addressed on this website. This is beta version with debug server.

## Installation

For simplicity you can use the repo created in repl environment under link https://repl.it/@FikratTalibli/bioalgs. However if used on local machine it is necessary to install ```flask``` and ```WTForms```. Installation is done using ```pip``` command.


## Usage
Simply run main.py file using flask or python. E.g.:
```python main.py```
